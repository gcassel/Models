#### About Penumbral

This is a placeholder entry for the development of *Penumbral* as a massively multiparticipant world-building, co-authorship and interactive adventure network. *Penumbral* integrates most of my artistic projects and goals for over three decades.  It's been delayed by my necessary focus on p2p organizing frameworks, which is (as it turns out) prerequisite work for doing *Penumbral* right.  

#### Form

I want to entwine multimedia narrative with an interactive map/encyclopedia.  At the very beginning, the user might start with a block of text, or with a very incomplete map that links to text and/or illustrations. Either way, the user will journey through a sprawling narrative that’s built out of “scenes.” Each scene is broken down into small units of text or “pages”. Pages will typically consist of 1-3 paragraphs.  They’ll often have one or more interactive elements: key words or phrases that are subtly marked with mouseover links for small popup windows, which can then be clicked to open up a side window.  (Perhaps an overlaying window on smaller displays.) These links may be short, optional textual “asides” that elaborate something that the characters are currently discussing or dealing with.  In other cases, they’ll be visual illustrations or audio samples of people, places or things. If the page refers to any new person, place or thing that will be of ongoing significance, it will indicate a new entry in the “cyclopedia” (encyclopedia). 

Both the cyclopedia and the map grow from (almost) scratch for each user.  For instance, if a new city is referenced, it gets a dot on the map and a brief cyclopedia entry of common, basic info; but its entry can expand dramatically over time, depending on future plot references. There will be a visual indication in the narrative whenever an existing cyclopedia entry is expanded, and the new information within that entry will be clearly highlighted.

One of my main goals is to create a world in which the central narrative isn’t always the main focus.  The cyclopedia can be a gateway to exploring aspects of the world that are entirely outside of the story.  For instance, some cyclopedia entries will automatically create other new entries.  It may also link to other stories that are mostly independent of the events in the main storyline.

The central narrative will be divided into “chapters” which each cover some span of time, within which the user may move non-linearly between separate storylines; but at some point, of course, each storyline must end for that chapter.  At that point, the user may find that some other storylines, or at least parts of them, are mandatory in order to open the next chapter. (However, "time traveling" will of course be thoroughly integrated with the sequential development of storytelling chapters.)

#### Setting

The setting for Penumbral is the (mostly) Earth-like planet of Volu.  Much background material exists, and will be imported (and collaboratively iterated) as needed into the main project.  

#### Creative Process

Penumbral can be generated by any number of compatible creators (persons or teams) using a distributed versioning system and community-supported content-rating tools.

#### Themes

technology, sustainable culture, magic, divergent dimensions  (this is intentionally extremely generic here, for now)

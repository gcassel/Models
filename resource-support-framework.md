#### About this Document

This is a written supplement to **[Resource Support Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1frX5ay_adnhdmaSbqCr-Z63_f1o7xyZN4e8IdI2hcts/edit?usp=sharing) (RSF)**. This document will provide some explanatory description, definitions, and (eventually) a verbal overview of that model.

#### Objectives

* **RSF is [meant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) to be a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) the [development](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) and [maintenance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/maintain.md) of any [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of *[community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*.**

* RSF is a primary [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [P2P Modular Organizing Diagram](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/p2p-modular-organizing-framework.md).

#### Features

*to-do: list important [features](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feature.md) of RSF*

#### Summary

*to-do: a simple summary will be developed from [Resource Support Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1frX5ay_adnhdmaSbqCr-Z63_f1o7xyZN4e8IdI2hcts/edit?usp=sharing)*

The abstractly reduced summary will [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) which can be separately [edited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md), *branched* or *forked*.

#### Notes

RSF is shared via https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.   I intend to release the main version into the public domain as soon as reasonably possible.

If RSF works as intended, its formal **Design** component (and activity) should wane in significance in the development of media networks-- being mostly replaced by spontaneous stigmergic p2p emergent development.

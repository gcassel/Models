This model will be a [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md) for effective *dialogue about [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)*.  

I [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) for this model to [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in the [Shared Resource Support and Development](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/shared-resource-support-and-development-system.md) model.

### Description

This document will serve as a verbal description and guide to the prototype ARA visual language and related models such as [Inclusive Organizing Systems](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing).  *(Work in progress.)*

#### Objectives

ARA [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as a [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) *visual [modeling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [mapping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* for all [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md)* and *[desired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* between [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md), [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) and [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md).

ARA is meant to help diverse *activists, organizers, designers and engineers* to accurately model and map *all [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) and [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* which they individually *or* [collectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md):

(1) **[perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md)** to have happened, or be happening

(2) **[predict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md)** or otherwise expect

(3) **[want](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)** to happen

(4) **[support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md)** or (when applicable) directly [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md)

ARA is further meant to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) the [identification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) of underappreciated [strengths](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md), [weaknesses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/cost.md), [potentials](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) and [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of perceived, predicted, wanted and/or supported actions.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), one key potential of ARA modeling and mapping is to highlight any [confusion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confuse.md) or [conflict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/conflict.md) between different agents' expectations, desires and commitments.

#### Features

* **[levels of organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organizing.md)**:  All identified functions in ARA can be directly [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) to one or more *levels of organizing* which support an intended process, system or [ecosystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/ecosystem.md) of [complex adaptive systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/complex-adaptive-system.md), *and* each level of organizing within each component-system. 
*   *consistent ID protocol*:  Distinguish all personal and collective resource-governing IDs as consistently visible (either directly or indirectly, and easily) by default (except for top secret collectives); by contrast, distinguish Collective Resource and Resource Version media items as variably open or closed access per the function of each resource.
*   *directional dependencies*: Model committees and subcommittees etcetera as *going down*/ inward;  model alliances as *going upward* (and COLLECTING more)
*   *scalable and navigable detail*: Each level of organizing should be viewable both separately and in relation to whole ecosystemic map, at any legible level of detail which the user selects.
* **[semantic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/semantic.md) [links](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md)**:  ARA should enable perceived and intended [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between formal elements to be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) and [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) as clearly and directly as possible.  Relationships may be described via directional functions which create [inputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) and [outputs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) between any identified [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md), including [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subsystem.md).
     * Examples: use standard blue hyperlink font color for unrelated external documents; use dark blue font for systemically-related external documents; use black for external definitions which are directly supported by the project in question; use green or teal for internal hyperlinks.
   * **cross-[context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) links:**  ARA should enable links to connect typically disjointed perceptual and design contexts including diverse [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).  For example, ARA should enable agents to clearly map relationships between the different [communities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) and [governing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) agents which support every subsystem for any all [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [applications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md) which those agents [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) to support their intended [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).  
   * **cross-organization links:**  Additionally, ARA should enable direct identification of links between components in semi-autonomous systems (including agents), *and* in different levels of organizing of the same system.
* *additional visual metalanguage*:  one default example is to use purple fonts to indicate unfinished sections & tasks-to-do
* **[coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) with [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/)**:  ARA will use the [termilogy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md) of *Modular Organizing Terminology*.  Effective development of ARA may influence MOT updates.

#### Specifications

See [Visual Metadata](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xAvZreY_9bc7slAuGnt3YKySY5IzrV8_tCnEYmfIiYc/edit#heading=h.u1zue0wgxb1o) in *Naming and Formatting Protocol* for specifications regarding text appearance.   (Note: this Git entry & that document need to eventually be further coordinated.)

#### Additional Notes

*This ARA framework is a slowly developing work-in-progress.  This is especially true because of the limited features of Google Drawings, and also of all alternative mapping and visualization tools which I'm currently aware of.*

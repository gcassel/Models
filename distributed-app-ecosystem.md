**About this Document**

This is a written supplement to **[Distributed App Ecosystem/Generic Template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1iO1kkr5UPxr3bzK6gSQJ6hODJn9OQRuvvytesVlOljc/edit?usp=sharing)**.  This document will provide some explanatory description, definitions, and (eventually) a verbal overview of that diagram.

Distributed App Ecosystem/Generic Template
------------------------------

**Objective:**  To provide a visual *[model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* and a *[mapping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md)* [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which can [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) within any [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [ecosystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/ecosystem.md) of *[distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [applications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)* and *[p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/P2P.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)*.

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Definitions and Descriptions** for this model and mapping system:

* **function**: Within the context of the DAE model, a *function* means a *[digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) [transmitting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) and/or [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* function.  Such functions can be [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [constructed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) through *[hierarchically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) layered* and/or [networked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md).

* **ecosystem**: a system of distributed apps *and* of p2p agents which [supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [goals].

* **agent**: an agent is p2p participant which plays a functional role within a specific 

* **level**:  this represents a [level of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md) which *contains a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of functions which [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a specific [parallel process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md)*.  (That parallel process is the *layer's function* within the ecosystem.)
  
* **traits**:  this represents a *set of relational elements* which identify the formal "behaviors"-- i.e., a types of interactivity -- which the described element possesses within an organizational context.   
   * Note:  Effectively defined traits often create semantic links which connect a formal element to another formal element.   If a trait does *not* link to another formal element, then the viewer may assume that that element is *supposed* to possess that behavior "globally" (i.e., in all valid interactions) *within its level of organization*.   However, traits which *do* create semantic links may describe relationships which *connect* different levels of organization.   (For example, an [output](relational element which identifies a "behavior"-- i.e., a type of interactivity -- of another element within a specific context.

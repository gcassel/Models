This is a placeholder entry for the relocation of **[Inclusive Action Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5V8LggadbbAaJw9tK_OT22VyciO4OE9ml1fiXYyfmk/edit?usp=sharing)** (IAF) to git as a modular document.  

IAF suggests a standardized cyclical process for inclusively developing any specific resources, including goals and media items.

IAF functions as a primary component of Resource Support Framework (RSF).   IAF also functions as a suggested model for inclusively developing proposals in Consent-Based Governance (CBG).

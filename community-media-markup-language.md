* be the basic system for the [Conversation for Action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/models/conversation-for-action.md) model
* have a mutually supportive relationship with the [Community Resource Support and Development System](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/models/community-resource-support-and-development-system.md)

------------------

The fundamentally collaborative RDF format identified above can:
 
* **Provide a deliberately minimal framework for the development of each autonomous community** and its media resources.
   * Note: even within the minimal suggested framework, each descriptive frame should be optional per community and per media contributor (sharer or linker)  
* **Enable each community to interactively develop a virtual, distributed community media directory** according to the options which that community enables for each media-sharing agent to permit or not permit other agents to apply comments, descriptions and evaluations to shared media items.
   * Fundamentally integrating p2p distributed hosting
* **Empower effective 'intercommunity' networking by breaking down falsely exclusive hierarchical media directories**, by promoting the application of RDFs to meaningfully and practically defined sections of data within copies files and recordings-- gradually (or suddenly) making subsets of data portable across different networks and storage devices.
   * Fundamentally integrating distributed versioning

With collaborative use of modular composite description and semantic links, this portable P2P RDF format should enable the consistent addressing and indexing of media items which are fully portable, interoperable with resilient APIs, and potentially compatible with all intentionally managed networks and communities.

**Notes:**  This imported entry (from [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing)) needs to be significantly refined.  Also, as *Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking* is modularly imported into github, each of the *resource description frames* which I've suggested above will be described in detail.

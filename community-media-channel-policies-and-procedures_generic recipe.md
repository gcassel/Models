This model will describe a generic recipe for developing sustainable governance of the explicit content and perceived behavior in a specific media channel, or any network of co-governed channels (including forums with hierarchically structured topics.)

This model will be derived from the Bridge the Divide Discussion Group's acting [policies and procedures](https://www.facebook.com/notes/bridge-the-divide-discussion-group/draft-bridge-the-divide-btd-policy-and-procedures-for-admins/1092789530746602/) for admins, which I (Greg) was a primary co-author of.  Using those policies and procedures, BTD has only used *official* disciplinary actions by *100% written consent* of acting admins for almost three years now.   

This model will be simplified from the BTD model, made generic for channels with any topic, and will support purely peer-based media governance for channels in varied technical formats, *without* facebook's extremely limited (crippling) group administration tools.   

This model for governing content in specific channels is directly supplementary to [Community Media Network Governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-media-network-governance.md).

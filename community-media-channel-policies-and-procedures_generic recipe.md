This model will describe a generic recipe for developing sustainable governance of the explicit content and perceived behaviors in a specific media channel, or any network of co-governed channels (including forums with hierarchically structured topics.)

This model will be derived from several sources including:
* [Bridge the Divide Discussion Group Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/notes/bridge-the-divide-discussion-group/official-bridge-the-divide-discussion-group-guidelines/763789280313297/)
    * These guidelines were collaboratively developed through community discussion and inputs in 2013, and have been used ever since with some minor edits.
* Bridge the Divide's acting [policies and procedures](https://www.facebook.com/notes/bridge-the-divide-discussion-group/draft-bridge-the-divide-btd-policy-and-procedures-for-admins/1092789530746602/) for admins
  *   Using those policies and procedures, BTD has only used *official* disciplinary actions by *100% written consent* of acting admins since March 2015. 
* [Enspiral Personal Conduct Agreement](https://github.com/enspiral/handbook/blob/master/agreements/personal_conduct.md)
   * I was the primary author in a team of four, although I left the creative team before final revisions and official adoption.
* [Enspiral Harassment and Abuse Policy](https://github.com/enspiral/handbook/blob/master/agreements/harassment_and_abuse.md)
    * I was a primary author and the primary editor.

This model will be simplified from existing models, made generic for channels with any topic, and will support purely peer-based media governance for channels in varied technical formats, *without* facebook's extremely limited (crippling) group administration tools.   

*Note:*  This model for governing content in specific channels is meant to directly supplement [Community Media Network Governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-media-network-governance.md), while being separately usable.

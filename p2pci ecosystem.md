### Objective

This is a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) which [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) many [levels of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md) in a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) "community tech ecosystem" for a worldwide community which supports the development of collective intelligence.    

### Key Features

*key organizing principle:*  **Intentionally governed, consent-based collectives can directly support ungoverned networks.**
*Note:* Similar principles have obviously operated in relationships such as WWW Foundation to the World Wide Web. However, we need to go far beyond that to genuinely develop worldwide intelligence.
		
*a new open digital network:* P2P Collective Intelligence (**P2PCI**)
   * P2PCI can be fully interoperable with the WWW, but will facilitate the development of hypertextual semantic links (and collective intelligence) beyond the false hierarchies which http encourages
   * P2PCI should easily enable specific communities to develop and attach customized [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-media-markup-language.md) to media items, including community-specific and private items
   
* *a new collective:* Supporters of Collective Intelligence/ **SCI**
   * SCI will support P2PCI by developing and supporting open resources, especially open communications protocols. 
   * SCI will use official self-governance standards.   (These standards may transform some of their open networking standards into internal rules.)
   * [Agreement-Based Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_xWEIay-2jyJ3Rqb6OgTxoZBJfjNW4d6w6ukXyeJk4/edit?usp=sharing) may function as the general governance recipe (and template) for SCI's governance structure.  However, the SCI members should create a specific governance plan/constitution.
   
* (bonus)  also illustrate OIC as an open network of intermedia which meets the OIC standard, which is governed by a "Supporters of OIC" community
   * mirror the structure of SOIC according to structure of SCI 
   * Open Intermedia Commons
      * definition: a network of media resources which meet a multivariate standard supported by “Supporters of Open Intermedia Commons” (SOIC), a new standards organization.   
      * SOIC will support the open media sharing standards described below, as well as people and groups who share media according to these standards.
      * SOIC will also support other open p2p media networking standards, such as (work-in-progress) Community Media Markup Language and Community Resource Description Framework, which facilitate efficient networking of all types of media, including private resources.

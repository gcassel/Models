**Definition** 

This is a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) which [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) many [levels of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md) in a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) "community tech ecosystem" for a worldwide community which supports the development of collective intelligence.    


			
		DETAILS:
		
		
		key principle: governed collectives/groups/orgs can directly support ungoverned networks
			-- this principle has long operated in relationships such as WWW Foundation to www; but we need to go several levels beyond this to develop collective intelligence
		
		• illustrate the open network (P2PCI?) which a collective ("Supporters of Collective Intelligence"?) supports via open resources (esp open standards)
			• this open network should easily enable specific communities to attach their own CMML to items, including community-specific and restricted items
		• additionally illustrate SCI, which supports P2PCI via governance tools (which transform some of their open standards into closed standards, in some formal contexts)  
			• of course ABG is the governance recipe; but name a specific governance plan (perhaps identifying some desired specs)
		• (bonus)  also illustrate OIC as an open network of intermedia which meets the OIC standard, which is governed by a "Supporters of OIC" community
			• mirror the structure of SOIC according to structure of SCI 
			•  Open Intermedia Commons
				• definition: a network of media resources which meet a multivariate standard supported by “Supporters of Open Intermedia Commons” (SOIC), a new standards organization.   
				• SOIC will support the open media sharing standards described below, as well as people and groups who share media according to these standards.
				• SOIC will also support other open p2p media networking standards, such as (work-in-progress) Community Media Markup Language and Community Resource Description Framework, which facilitate efficient networking of all types of media, including private resources.

### Objective

This is a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md) which [describes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) many [levels of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md) in a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) "community tech ecosystem" for a worldwide community which supports the development of collective intelligence.    

### Key Features

Key Organizing Principle:  **Intentionally governed, consent-based collectives can directly support ungoverned networks.**
*Note:* This principle has long operated in relationships such as WWW Foundation to the World Wide Web; however, we need to go several levels beyond that to genuinely develop worldwide intelligence.
		
* describe the open network (**P2PCI**) which a collective (Supporters of Collective Intelligence/ **SCI**) supports via open resources (esp open standards)
   * this open network should easily enable specific communities to attach their own CMML to items, including community-specific and restricted items
* additionally describe SCI, which supports P2PCI via official self-governance tools (which may transform some of their open standards into closed standards, in some internal organizing contexts)
   * of course ABG is the governance recipe; but name a specific governance plan (perhaps identifying some desired specs)
* (bonus)  also illustrate OIC as an open network of intermedia which meets the OIC standard, which is governed by a "Supporters of OIC" community
   * mirror the structure of SOIC according to structure of SCI 
   * Open Intermedia Commons
      * definition: a network of media resources which meet a multivariate standard supported by “Supporters of Open Intermedia Commons” (SOIC), a new standards organization.   
      * SOIC will support the open media sharing standards described below, as well as people and groups who share media according to these standards.
      * SOIC will also support other open p2p media networking standards, such as (work-in-progress) Community Media Markup Language and Community Resource Description Framework, which facilitate efficient networking of all types of media, including private resources.

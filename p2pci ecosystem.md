### Objective

This is a [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) (and, eventually, a [map](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md)) describing a [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) *[community tech ecosystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/Community%20Tech%20Ecosystem:%20generic%20template.md)* for a worldwide community which supports the development of peer-to-peer collective intelligence.    

### Key Features

* *key organizing principle:*  **Intentionally governed, consent-based collectives can directly support ungoverned networks.**
   * *Note:* Similar principles have obviously operated in relationships such as WWW Foundation to the World Wide Web. However, we need to go far beyond that to genuinely develop collective intelligence.
		
* *a new open digital network:* **P2P Collective Intelligence/ P2PCI**
   * P2PCI can be fully interoperable with the WWW, but will facilitate the development of hypertextual semantic links (and collective intelligence) beyond the false hierarchies which http encourages.
   * P2PCI should easily enable specific communities to develop and attach customized [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-media-markup-language.md) to media items, including community-specific and private items.
   
* *a new collective:* **[P2PCI Project](https://github.com/P2PCI-project/P2PCI-Platform)/ P2PCIP** (or **Supporters of Collective Intelligence/SCI**)
   * P2PCIP will support P2PCI by developing and supporting open resources, especially open communications protocols. 
   * P2PCIP will be closely related to and interlinked with the [P2PCI Platform](http://confocal-manawatu.pbworks.com/w/page/106804227/P2P%20Collective%20Intelligence%20Platform) on LikeinMind.
   * P2PCIP will use official self-governance standards.  (These standards may transform some of their open networking standards into internal rules.)
   * [Agreement-Based Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_xWEIay-2jyJ3Rqb6OgTxoZBJfjNW4d6w6ukXyeJk4/edit?usp=sharing) may function as P2PCIP's general governance recipe (and template) for P2PCIP's governance structure.  However, the P2PCIP members should create a specific consent-based governance plan (constitution).
   
* *another new open digital network:*  **[Open Intermedia Commons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RfXaOCg4VBZ2tcKu1tjBPIkabGruSLueH4T4g_8cWTs/edit?usp=sharing)/OIC**
   * definition: a network of media resources which meet a multivariate open licensing standard
   
* *another new collective:*  **Supporters of Open Intermedia Commons/SOIC**
   * SOIC will directly support and develop at least one version of the OIC open licensing standard.
   * SOIC's governing structure may mirror the structure of P2PCIP.  (It may develop a different, but overlapping, team of governing agents.)
   * SOIC will support the open OIC media sharing standards, as well as people and groups who share media according to those standards.
   * SOIC will also support other P2PCI standards, such as (work-in-progress) Community Media Markup Language and Community Resource Description Framework, which facilitate efficient networking of all types of media, including private resources.

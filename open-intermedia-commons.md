This is a placeholder document for the relocation and development of **[Open Intermedia Commons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8MJUhsQUhRD4_xzepsoqBu4jX-nZYy7Pf2OqbCY--o/edit?usp=sharing)** as a model/recipe for the development of an efficient, justly distributed media sharing network which enables full development of community-based models for *[openly-licensed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/open-license.md)* media submissions, ratings, sorting and filtering options.

The Open Intermedia Commons document will be rebuilt to reflect our potential for a gradually (or suddenly) developing shift from cooperatively-owned central servers and platforms to deeply distributed [peer-to-peer digital networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/p2p-digital-networking.md).

**Notes:** 

This *[fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md)* shared RDF model can:
 
* **Provide an intentionally minimal framework for the development of each autonomous community** and that community's media resources.
   * Note: even within the minimal suggested framework, *each descriptive frame should be optional* per community and per media contributor (sharer or linker)  
* **Enable each community to interactively develop a virtual, distributed community media directory** according to the options which that community enables for each media-sharing agent to permit or not permit other agents to apply comments, descriptions and evaluations to shared media items.
   * This function is fundamentally compatible with *p2p distributed media hosting*
* **Empower effective 'intercommunity' networking by transcending our *falsely exclusive and hierarchical* existing media directories**, by promoting the linking of RDFs to *meaningfully and practically defined (formal and/or conceptual) elements* within instances of files and recordings-- gradually (or suddenly) *making those subsets of data [portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md)* across different networks and storage devices.
   * This function is fundamentally compatible with *p2p distributed versioning*

With collaborative use of modularly descriptive metadata and linked data, this portable P2P RDF format should enable the consistent addressing and indexing of media items which are fully portable, compatible with relevant open [application programming interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/API.md), and *potentially compatible with any intentionally managed community*.

**Construction Note:**  This imported entry (from [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing)) still needs to be significantly refined.  Also, as *Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking* is modularly imported into github, each of the *resource description frames* which I've suggested above will be described in detail.

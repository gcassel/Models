**Clarifying Notes:**

The intended structure (relationships) above is poorly visualized in this simple draft Markdown entry.   For example, *Attribute/Evaluation Databases(, *autonomous versioning links* and *comments* are simply *subtypes* of *Linked Media*.  I'll attach one or more richly formatted text versions and/or a diagram later.

* *media format* should identify the CRDF framework itself, and the format of the framed data (media item)
* *community identity* should be formally related to distributed [public key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) principles.
* *editor identities* is only relevant to media in (most) communities which complexly enable separate *viewing and editing rights* for specific media items.
* *host identities* may only be relevant for communities which do NOT use fully distributed p2p media hosting, possibly per [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) or another distributed signaling, storage and processing standard.
* *authorized viewer identities* is only relevant for media which is licensed or restricted to be *private or secret*.   For example, that would include nondisclosure agreements/NDAs, but also potentially sophisticated media sharing options which may be customized per level of organization of complex networks, and/or customized per personal user relationships.

**Purpose:** 

This *[fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [collaborative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md)* community RDF model can:
 
* **Provide an intentionally minimal framework for the development of each autonomous community** and that community's media resources.
   * Note: even within the minimal suggested framework, *each descriptive frame should be optional* per community and per media contributor (sharer or linker)  
* **Enable each community to interactively develop a virtual, distributed community media directory** according to the options which that community enables for each media-sharing agent to permit or not permit other agents to apply comments, descriptions and evaluations to shared media items.
   * This function is fundamentally compatible with *p2p distributed media hosting*
* **Empower effective 'intercommunity' networking by transcending our *falsely exclusive and hierarchical* existing media directories**, by promoting the linking of RDFs to *meaningfully and practically defined (formal and/or conceptual) elements* within instances of files and recordings-- gradually (or suddenly) *making those subsets of data [portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md)* across different networks and storage devices.
   * This function is fundamentally compatible with *p2p distributed versioning*

With collaborative use of modularly descriptive metadata and linked data, this portable P2P RDF format should enable the consistent addressing and indexing of media items which are fully portable, compatible with relevant open [application programming interfaces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/API.md), and *potentially compatible with any intentionally managed community*.

**Construction Notes:**  This imported entry (from [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing)) still needs to be significantly refined.  Also, as *Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking* is modularly imported into github, each of the *resource description frames* which I've suggested above will be described in detail.

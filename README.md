# Models

### 6/26/21 Update:  This repository is no longer a useful guide to most of my works; please see [Inclusive Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing) and its linked documents instead.
**Description** 

This [repository](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/repository.md) contains [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/model.md) (often [prototypes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/prototype.md)) [representing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/representation.md) [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/potential.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/use.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) such as [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/tool.md), [techniques](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/technique.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/system.md).

I intend for this repository to focus on [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/specialize.md) models, in contrast to the [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/generic.md) visual and verbal [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/language.md) of *[MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/)* and *[ARA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cO_s2x5Aky-GnrhX2Tj8hFtj3s6qGKzugEf8AQiiXRg/edit?usp=sharing)*.

**Notes**  

Some of the models here could [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) within a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/P2P.md) [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), such as this repository's own p2p networking model [here](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/p2p-digital-networking.md).

***[Inclusive Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing)* illustrates perceived relationships between some of these models, and others.**

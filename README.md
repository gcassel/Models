# Models

**Description:** 

This [repository](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/repository.md) contains [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/model.md) and prototypes [representing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/representation.md) [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/potential.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/use.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) such as [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/tool.md), [techniques](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/technique.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/system.md).

**Notes:**  

Some of the models here could [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) within a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/P2P.md) [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md), such as this repository's own p2p networking model [here](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/p2p-digital-networking.md).

**[P2P Modular Organization](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1rIZxaRDWTOWrm3Ucslid6JO_MikP92GPFMdclgT93es/edit?usp=sharing)** illustrates perceived relationships between some of these models (and others).

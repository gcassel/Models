This is a placeholder entry for the relocation of **[3D Development Recipe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5V8LggadbbAaJw9tK_OT22VyciO4OE9ml1fiXYyfmk/edit?usp=sharing)** (3DD) to git as a modular document.  

3DD suggests a standardized cyclical process for inclusively developing any specific resources, including goals and media items.

3DD functions as a primary component of Resource Support Framework (RSF).  3DD also functions as a suggested model for inclusively developing proposals in Consent-Based Governance (CBG).

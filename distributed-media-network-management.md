This is a placeholder document for the relocation of [Distributed Media Network Management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cU0557pbNOAI2eco2Ura3HXdxC2v-SJBWMHYaGMHMtA/edit?usp=sharing) to Github as a modular document.  

As noted in the current draft of DMNM, the model needs to be restructured to facilitate the modular, fractal and composite generation of peer-to-peer networks, with agreement-based governance of participant roles, rights and responsibilities.

Distributed versioning will facilitate the full development of a generic Community Governance model with another version focused on the special challenges of governing online media networks.

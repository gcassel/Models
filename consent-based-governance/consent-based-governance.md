This is a placeholder document for the reiteration of [Consent-Based Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_xWEIay-2jyJ3Rqb6OgTxoZBJfjNW4d6w6ukXyeJk4/edit?usp=sharing) via modular documents in distributed version control. For example, many descriptive passages in the existing ABO document will be moved here.

That reiteration should facilitate more coordinated creative development, potentially including alternative branches or forks which are managed by different persons or groups.

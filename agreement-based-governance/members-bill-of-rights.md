1.5 A “Membership Bill of Rights” for official agreements 
=======================


**(1) No person will be a member of an agreement unless they directly consent to it in writing.**

**(2) Agreements may persist indefinitely, or they may expire at internally specified dates.**

* For instance, groups may conduct experiments which automatically expire unless their members review and renew the terms at specified dates.

**(3) Agreements may specify any desired conditions for the addition of new members.**  

* Some especially inclusive agreements may be openly available to the public.  
* Some agreements may be open to all members of an identified (and accountable) group.
* More exclusive, trust-based agreements may suggest requirements such as:
   * At least one current member proposes the addition of a potential member.
   * All other current members consent to the addition of the new member.

**(4) Members will be free to leave agreements, or groups of hierarchically related agreements, via written notification.**

* If members are unable to directly remove their names from the official list of members, then the list’s administrator(s) should try to accommodate each removal request in a reasonably timely manner.
* Agreements may directly specify official, enforceable consequences for early withdrawal from important commitments and contracts.

**(5) Agreements will not be altered, or attached unconditionally to other agreements, without the consent of all active members in good standing.**
  
* Agreement-based groups will only pass binding proposals after votes have been registered by all active members (see #6 below), or by other participation standards which they mutually agree to.  
* It’s additionally recommended that consent should not be the sole metric for passing proposals in existing groups.  For instance, groups may require a majority or supermajority of “Agree” votes, or use finely scaled content rating systems. Groups are encouraged to explore this directly, instead of relying on general standards.
* Bear in mind that even within a group context, most personal activity can’t, and shouldn’t, require a collective decision!  People may operate freely by default, in the absence of coercive forces.  Peers may co-operate freely within any explicitly defined limits of intentionally shared environments.

**(6) Members of agreements, or group of agreements, should be able to easily assume official ‘inactive status’ regarding proposed changes or additions to their existing agreements.**

* This can help groups to avoid cases of unintended obstruction by distracted or inactive members.  
* Recommended tool: give each agreement’s members a simple option to openly toggle their status as active/inactive.  However, many groups may benefit from establishing guidelines (and accounting tools) which describe the expected participation level of members.

**(7) Members may create agreements which will impose inactive status on unresponsive members, either (a) case-by-case or (b) according to accessibly defined automatic procedures.**

* Such agreements should consider the principle that group-wide binding agreements should not be rushed.  Time-sensitive matters can be handled via separate agreements which sanction unofficial actions and emergency powers.  (See Developing group tasks and roles.)  Such agreements can enable lenient standards for members’ participation in non-emergency decisions.

**(8) New or amended agreements will not impose new commitments upon inactive members.**  

* If inactive members desire to return to active status, and are eligible to do so, new commitments may be required of them.
* Similarly, groups which extend permissions and privileges to outside parties-- for example, with ‘Terms of Service’ agreements-- may modify those terms and cancel previous versions.  Normally, other parties have the option to re-establish such agreements by accepting the new terms.

**(9) Members may create any mutually desired rules for potentially suspending or removing members who act harmfully or in bad faith.**

* Such rules may be analogous to the impeachment rules in many governmental bodies.
* Alternatively, members may create new or modified agreements (see Distributed version control) and remove themselves from prior versions,  leaving clearly estranged partners behind.  This strategy would especially emphasize our personal agency and autonomy.

**(10)  Agreements, and all contact information and media related to them, should be freely available and easily accessible to all of their members, without depending on proprietary software or hardware formats.**

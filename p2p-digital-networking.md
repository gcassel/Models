This is a placeholder document for the reiteration of [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing) via modular sections in distributed version control.  For example, many descriptive passages in the existing P2PDN document will be moved [here](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).

That reiteration should facilitate more coordinated creative development, potentially including alternative branches or forks which are managed by different persons or groups.

**Notes:*  

* The refactoring of descriptive elements in many components such as [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/models/community-media-markup-language.md) etc. may reduce P2PDN to a relatively compact and simple role as a unifying framework for completely sustainable p2p digital networking.

* **The retained role for P2PDN itself will be based mostly if not entirely on the document's verbal overview and visual overview diagram**

**Verbal Overview** (prototype here from [this section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit#heading=h.f01q2uhdhbpn) of P2PDN)

The following description provides a high level overview of recommended p2p networking elements, forms and processes, to eventually be illustrated by a comprehensive set of diagrams:  

Agents gradually organize by using digital identities to authorize each other to receive and (sometimes) send data from/to specific (personal and group) signal addresses, using secure p2p signaling standards for both streaming and messaging.  

At the same time, people gradually organize as viewers and editors of data storage paths.  Storage path editors extend viewing and editing rights to develop community media resource addresses.  This enables the development of complex systems of specialized addresses, including discussion channels and forums, which have community-defined participation roles such as guests, contributors and members.

Inclusive discussion, media-tagging and evaluation processes are used to further develop community media resources via portable and dynamically updated resource description frameworks (RDFs), which globally map public and private resource addresses via international resource identifiers (IRIs). 

Dynamically updated RDFs enable (a) community-defined differentiation of media resources using modular, composite and hierarchical organizing forms, and (b) flexibly user-defined sorting, filtering and searching of media resources.

Communities develop distributed p2p file hosting to make each of its community-supported and portably-described media resources independent of all specific storage devices, drives and servers.  

Distributively-hosted community media resources are linked into intercommunity distributed versioning systems, and may be related more indirectly and organically to other media via semantically linked data including media attributes and evaluations by participants in formally related communities.

**Visual Overview Diagram** (prototype [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1neVhCEEsi-PeYYPnCkzigcJ1m86jy8TzbBafz4JBdeY/edit?usp=sharing))

   * The derived diagram will:
      * simplify person-digital identity-agent relationships
      * streamline the potentially distributed relationships between agents, apps and devices
      * **directly relate [Community Resource Support and Development System](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-resource-support-and-development-system.md), [Conversation for Action](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/conversation-for-action.md) and [Agreement-Based Governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/agreement-based-governance.md) to shared resources including all protocols and addresses**
      * directly link the diagram's RDF element to [Community Resource Description Framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-resource-description-framework.md)
      * directly relate [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-media-markup-language.md) to the Community Media Resource Description Framework

This is a placeholder document for the reiteration of [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing) via modular sections in distributed version control.  For example, many descriptive passages in the existing P2PDN document will be moved [here](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).

That reiteration should facilitate more coordinated creative development, potentially including alternative branches or forks which are managed by different persons or groups.

*Note:*  The refactoring of descriptive elements in many components such as [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/models/community-media-markup-language.md) etc. may reduce P2PDN to a relatively compact and simple role as a unifying framework for completely sustainable p2p digital networking.

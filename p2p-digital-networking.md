This is a placeholder document for the reiteration of [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing) via modular sections in distributed version control.  For example, many descriptive passages in the existing P2PDN document will be moved [here](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).

That reiteration should facilitate more coordinated creative development, potentially including alternative branches or forks which are managed by different persons or groups.

**Notes:*  

* The refactoring of descriptive elements in many components such as [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/models/community-media-markup-language.md) etc. may reduce P2PDN to a relatively compact and simple role as a unifying framework for completely sustainable p2p digital networking.

* The retained role for P2PDN itself will include a high level overview model, including a diagram derived from [P2P Digital Networking: General Model](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1neVhCEEsi-PeYYPnCkzigcJ1m86jy8TzbBafz4JBdeY/edit?usp=sharing)
   * The derived diagram will:
      * simplify person-digital identity-agent relationships
      * streamline the potentially distributed relationships between agents, apps and devices
      * **directly relate [Community Resource Support and Development System](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-resource-support-and-development-system.md), [Conversation for Action](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/conversation-for-action.md) and [Agreement-Based Governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/agreement-based-governance.md) to shared resources including all protocols and addresses**
      * directly link the diagram's RDF element to [Community Resource Description Framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-resource-description-framework.md)
      * directly relate [Community Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/community-media-markup-language.md) to the Community Media Resource Description Framework

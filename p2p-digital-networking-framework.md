#### About this Document 

###### Author: [Greg Cassel](https://github.com/gcassel/Essays/blob/master/authors-profile_greg-cassel.md)
###### This is a placeholder document for the reiteration of [Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit?usp=sharing) via modular sections in distributed version control.  For example, many descriptive passages in the existing P2PDN document will be moved [here](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology) as [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/module.md) entries including [definitions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/define.md) and supplementary [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/describe.md).

###### That reiteration should facilitate more coordinated creative development, potentially including alternative branches or forks which are managed by different persons or groups.

###### The refactoring of descriptive elements into many components such as [Collective Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/models/collective-media-markup-language.md) etc. may reduce P2PDN to a relatively compact and simple role as a unifying framework for completely sustainable p2p digital networking.

###### The retained role for P2PDN itself will be based mostly on the document's current *verbal overview* and *visual overview diagram*

#### Introductory Essay
[Peer-to-Peer Digital Networking: How the Internet Should Work](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/peer-peer-digital-networking-internet-work/2016/10/28)

### Verbal Overview
##### *(note: this prototype has been adapted from [this section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O7tJQVMHETSoWRpYC9eYsqi58ELL0Euv6L6d21LC6m0/edit#heading=h.f01q2uhdhbpn) of P2PDN)*

The following description provides a high level overview of recommended p2p networking elements, forms and processes, to eventually be illustrated by a comprehensive set of diagrams:  

#### Receive/Send Authorization
People [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [organize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md) as *[digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [identities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identity.md)* which [authorize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authorize.md) each other to *[receive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/receive.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)* from and (sometimes) *[send](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/send.md) data* to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [channels](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/channel.md), using *[secure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/secure.md) [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/p2p.md) signaling [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md)* for both [streaming](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/stream.md) and [messaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/message.md).  

#### View/Edit Authorization

People simultaneously organize as [viewers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/view.md) and [editors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md) of data [storage addresses](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/storage-address.md) and [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) [locations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md).  Storage location editors [distribute](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) viewing and editing rights to [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [collective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md).  This enables the development of [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) addresses, including [forums](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/forum.md), which have collectively-[specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) *[participation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)* such as Guests, Contributors, Members and Stewards. (See [Inclusive Governance Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cU0557pbNOAI2eco2Ura3HXdxC2v-SJBWMHYaGMHMtA/edit?usp=sharing).)

#### Collective RDFs

[Inclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md), [annotation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/annotate.md) and [evaluation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/evaluate.md) is used to further develop collective media resources via portable and dynamically updated resource description frameworks (RDFs), which globally map public and private resource addresses via international resource identifiers (IRIs). Dynamically updated RDFs enable (a) community-defined differentiation of media resources using modular, composite and hierarchical organizing forms, and (b) flexibly user-defined sorting, filtering and searching of media resources.

#### Distributed Computing

Collectives develop p2p [distributed computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/distributed-computing.md) to make each of its *[community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md)-[supported](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md)* and *[portably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md)-described* media resources [independent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/independent.md) of all specific storage [devices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) and data [servers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md).  

People link distributively-hosted collective media resources to intercollective [distributed versioning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/distributed-version-control.md) systems, and relate their media more indirectly and organically to other media via [associative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) [hyperlinks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md) and [semantically linked data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/semantic-link.md), including *media [attributes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/attribute.md) and evaluations* by participants in [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) related collectives.

#### Visual Overview Diagram
   * *prototype [here](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1neVhCEEsi-PeYYPnCkzigcJ1m86jy8TzbBafz4JBdeY/edit?usp=sharing)*
   * The derived diagram will:
      * simplify person-digital identity-agent relationships
      * streamline the potentially distributed relationships between agents, apps and devices
      * **directly relate [Resource Support Framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/resource-support-framework.md), [Inclusive Design Framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/inclusive-design-framework.md) and [Consent-Based Governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/consent-based-governance/consent-based-governance.md) to shared resources including all protocols and addresses**
      * directly link the diagram's RDF element to [Collective Resource Description Framework](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/collective-resource-description-framework.md)
      * directly relate [Collective Media Markup Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/collective-media-markup-language.md) to the Community Media Resource Description Framework

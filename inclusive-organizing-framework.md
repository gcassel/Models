**[Inclusive Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing)**(IOF) is developmental framework which suggests a methodical process for inclusively and scalably developing all types of collectives and networks, including distributive networks.  IOF integrates most of my other organizing models either directly or indirectly.

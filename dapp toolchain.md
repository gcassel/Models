**About this Document**

This is a written supplement to the major *dapp toolchain* [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of [P2P Modular Organizing Diagram](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/p2p-modular-organizing-diagram.md).  This document will provide some explanatory description, definitions, and (eventually) a verbal overview of that [model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md).

**Objective:**  To provide a visual *[model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* and a *[mapping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md)* [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which can [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) within any [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [ecosystem](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/ecosystem.md) which [supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) and [sustains](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [dapp](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dapp.md).

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Definitions and Descriptions** for this model and mapping system:

* **function**: Within the context of the DAE model, a *function* means a *[digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) [transmitting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transmit.md) and/or [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* function.  Such functions can be [complexly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [constructed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) through *[hierarchically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) layered* and/or [networked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md).
   *  **Each function may have its own formal ID, Description and Traits.**
   *  **Each function may have its own levels of organization.**

* **ecosystem**: a system of distributed apps *and* of p2p agents which [supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [goals].

* **agent**: an agent is p2p participant which plays a functional role within a specific 

* **level**:  this represents a [level of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md) which *contains a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of functions which [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a specific [parallel process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md)*.  (That parallel process *is the layer's function within the ecosystem*.)
  
* **traits**:  this represents a *set of relational elements* which identify the formal "behaviors"-- i.e., a types of interactivity -- which the described element possesses within an organizational context.   
   * Note:  Effectively defined traits often create semantic links which connect a formal element to another formal element.   If a trait does *not* link to another formal element, then the viewer may assume that that element is *supposed* to possess that behavior "globally" (i.e., in all valid interactions) *within its level of organization*.   However, traits which *do* create semantic links may describe relationships which *connect* different levels of organization.   (For example, an [output](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) from one function may be specified as an [input](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/input.md) for another level of organization, or even for a different ecosystem.)  
   
*   **link**:  visual *links* indicate formal relationships between different functions. These are fundamentally important to the DAE model.  

About Links
=============

   *  A link may (and should) have its own ID, description and traits-- just as each level and each function may have.
   *  A link should be formally constrained by identifying *each* of its types of *input* and *output* as a Trait.  Furthermore, inputs and outputs may be complexly bundled by mutually required relationship/responsibility to each other.
   *  **It will be very important to clearly display directionality of links, so that the flow from input to output is visible from a high level overview.**
   *  **Links should clearly indicate the nature of linkage such as app-to-app, app-to human agent, human agent-to- human agent  etc.**
   *  **Links can (and ultimately should) be automatically generated by assigning traits properly to each element.**

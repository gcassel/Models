**[Inclusive Organizing Systems](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing)** is a [schematic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/schematic.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the full [technology stack](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/technology-stack.md) of [developmental frameworks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/developmental-framework.md) in
[Inclusive Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing), along with a related [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [distributed application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dapp.md) stack.  IOS uses an early form of [ARA Visual Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/agent-resource-action-design-visual-language.md).

The stack-based structure of Inclusive Organizing Systems enables the systematic development of superstructures which add [complexly adaptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/complex-adaptive-system.md) organizational features.  However, it's a [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) design in which each developmental framework is separately usable.  Different frameworks would be more or less relevant to existing [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) or new [projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/project.md).  This modular design encourages multimodal and multi-perspectival approaches.

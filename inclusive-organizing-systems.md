**[Inclusive Organizing Systems](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-WFMRYdueSBba1atcohX0G585zj-gBNlBvZQBqnEmEs/edit?usp=sharing)** is a [schematic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/schematic.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the full [technology stack](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/technology-stack.md) of [Inclusive Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_KwMbdghVVv1FODuy21QsXXXHsAKTLGc0YGT64oh0mg/edit?usp=sharing) along with a related [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [distributed application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dapp.md) stack.  IOS uses an early form of [ARA Visual Language](https://github.com/gcassel/Models/blob/master/agent-resource-action-design-visual-language.md).

Inclusive Organizing Systems is based on developmental stacks, enabling methodical development of organizational superstructures which add complexly adaptive functionality.  However, it's a [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) design in which each developmental framework is separately usable.  Different frameworks would be more or less relevant to existing [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) or new projects.  This modular design encourages multimodal and multi-perspectival approaches.
